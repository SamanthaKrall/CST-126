I can not wait for spring to officially be here and stay. Not only am I looking forward to warmer weather, but new growth and flowers as well. ";"Seasons changing"

5;"";"Tree Frogs";"Are they ever on the ground?";"A tree frog is a species of frog that spends a major portion of its lifespan in trees, known as an arboreal state. Many millions of years of convergent evolution have resulted in almost identical morphology and ecologies. They are so similar as regards their ecological niche that in one biome where one group of tree frogs occurs, the other is almost always absent. The last common ancestor of some such tree frog groups lived long before the extinction of the dinosaurs. As their name implies, these frogs are typically found in trees or other high growing vegetation. They do not normally descend to the ground, except to mate and spawn, though some build foam nests on leaves and rarely leave the trees at all as adults. Tree frogs are usually tiny as their weight has to be carried by the branches and twigs in their habitats. ";"Tree Frogs"
6;"SamanthaKrall";"Plague killing frogs";"The plague killing frogs everywhere is worse than scientists thought";"As a threat to wildlife, an amphibian fungus has become the most deadly pathogen known to science. The mossy red eyed frog is one of hundreds of species threatened by a virulent fungus that may be responsible for ninety extinctions in the past fifty years. On Thursday, forty one scientists published the first worldwide analysis of a fungal outbreak thats been wiping out frogs for decades. The devastation turns out to be far worse than anyone had previously realized. Writing in the journal of science, the researchers conclude that populations of more than 500 species of amphibians have declined significantly because of the outbreak- including at least ninety species presumed to have gone extinct. The figure is more than twice as large as earlier estimated. Thats fairly seismic, said Wendy Palen, a biologist at Simon Fraser University who is a co-author of a commentary accompanying the study. It now earns the moniker of the most deadly pathogen known to science. ";"Froggies"
